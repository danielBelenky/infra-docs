Service Upgrade Checklist
===========================

Here's a simple but useful checklist that will help you when upgrading any of
the infra services:


* Make sure that backups are working ok
* Decide which version to upgarde to
* Setup a date and time for the upgrade
* Send an email to infra and devel lists with the date and time and a short
  summary of the fixed bugs and new features, and if there would be a downtime
  of any services
* If possible, create a snapshot before the upgrade itself
* 5 minutes before the upgrade starts, send a remainder to infra and devel
  lists
* Once the upgrade has finished, reply to the previous email with the upgrade
  results and summary
