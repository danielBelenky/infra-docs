System groovy jenkins scripts
=============================

The jenkins master server holds a few useful groovy scripts
Which can be used to run common tasks directly from the UI.
The scripts can be found under the [scriptler] plugin URL.

Additional scripts can be found on the scriptler github project
and shown also inside the plugin as [remote script catalogs]
Examples for existing tasks:
