Infra Docs
---------------------

Here is all the infra related documentation, this should be also found
in the official page, though the deploy process is not defined yet as
it's under development.

For now, storing it all in markdown [m_src] format seems to be generic
enough to let any future implementation use it.

Building
-------------
Until the final procedures are figured out, you can generate the wiki
markup from these files using [pandoc][p_src].
